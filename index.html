            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jeremy. I'm an IT person with an interest in networking.</p>
            <p>To get some hands-on experience building, configuring, and maintaining a network, I'm building a small, inexpensive homelab.</p>
            <p>I'm learning as I go, so I also built this webpage to document the process.</p>
            <p>Currently the lab consists of four Raspberry Pis and a switch. Each Pi serves a different function in the LAN.</p>

                <p>jeremy01 is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 1 GB of RAM.</p>

                <p>jeremy02 a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 1 GB of RAM.</p>
                <p>jeremy02 serves as the database server for the network. It is running MariaDB.</p>

                <p>jeremy03 is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 1 GB of RAM.</p>
                <p>jeremy03 serves as the DNS server for the network. It is running dnsmasq.</p>

            <div class='text-box'>
                <p>jeremy04 a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8 GB of RAM.</p>
                <p>jeremy04 serves as the web server for the network. It is running a simple web server built with Node.js. It is also running Apache for testing purposes.</p>

            <div class='text-box'>
                <p>All four of the Raspberry Pis are plugged into a Ubiquiti switch.</p>
                <p>Usually just one Pi is connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and from that Pi I can establish SSH connections with the other three.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>step-by-step</h2>
            <div class='step'>
                <p>This project uses four Raspberry Pi 4 Model Bs, one with 8 GB of RAM and the other three with 1 GB. The first step was the "create boot media???" for them, then configure their host names and static IP addresses, and document their MAC addresses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='step'>
                <p>The next step was to install and configure dnsmasq on jeremy03, and edit the host file on jeremy03. Then I tested the configuration by connecting to each of the other Pis from jeremy03 via SSH. Because it's only practical to have one Pi connected to monitor, keyboard, and mouse at a time, I wanted to be able to SSH from any Pi into any other Pi. I might change this later.</p>
