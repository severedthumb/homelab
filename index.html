            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>A brief explanation of this project will go here.</p>
            <p>My homelab consists, for the the moment, of four Raspberry Pis, plugged into a switch. Each serves a different function in this tiny LAN.</p>

            <h3>jeremy01</h3>
            <p>jeremy01 is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 1 GB of RAM.</p>
            <p>For now, jeremy01 does nothing.</p>
            
            <h3>jeremy02</h3>
            <p>jeremy02 a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 1 GB of RAM.</p>
            <p>jeremy02 serves as the database server for the network. It is running MariaDB.</p>
            
            <h3>jeremy03</h3>
            <p>jeremy03 is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 1 GB of RAM.</p>
            <p>jeremy03 serves as the DNS server for the network. It is running dnsmasq.</p>

            <h3>jeremy04</h3>
            <p>jeremy04 a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8 GB of RAM.</p>
            <p>jeremy04 serves as the web server for the network. It is running a simple web server built with Node.js. It is also running Apache for testing purposes.</p>

            <h3>Other equipment</h3>
            <p>All four of the Raspberry Pis are plugged into a Ubiquiti switch.</p>
            <p>Usually just one Pi is connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and from that Pi I can establish SSH connections with the other three.</p>
